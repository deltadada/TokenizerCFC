Welcome to Tokenizer 1.1!

Tokenizer is a Nonce/Token management system for preventing XSRF (cross site request forgery) on coldfusion based forms.
It's purpose is to create a simple standardized way to manage tokens and prevent blind posts that could be hazardous to
your users or system. Check out the examples, tokenizer.riaforge.org, and designfrontier.net if you have questions or issues.

The article about Tokenizer and implementing it is here: http://designfrontier.net/articles/?id=9

Requirements
-----------------------------------------
Tokenizer has been tested on CF 9.0.1 and Railo 3.2.2+. It should also work on CF 8 and OpenBD, though it has not been
tested in these configurations. 

If you test it and it works email daniel@designfrontier.net and I'll add it to this list and credit you with testing 
it. Thanks!

The application.cfc in the examples is heavily based on Ben Nadel's application.cfc template (http://www.bennadel.com/blog/726-ColdFusion-Application-cfc-Tutorial-And-Application-cfc-Reference.htm). The concept 
for tokenizer draws heavily on Jason Dean's may fantastic security articles (htttp://12robots.com) which you should be reading. The AJAX header code draws on http://existdissolve.com/2010/10/cfscript-alternative-to-cfheader/  for writing headers in cfscript.
