<h1>Tokenzier Example Files</h1>
<p>First off welcome to Tokenizer! It's going to make your life so much easier, you won't even believe it ;) Tokenizer is hosted on <a href="http://tokenizer.riaforge.org">Riaforge</a> and was created by <a href="http://designfrontier.net">Daniel Sellers</a>. So if you have questions those are good places to start. If the answers aren't there then please email me <a href="mailto:daniel@designfrontier.net">daniel@designfrontier.net</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/daniel_sellers">tweet me</a> and I'll do my best to help you out. Good luck and happy hacking!</p>
<p>These are the tokenizer example docs. They make a couple of assumptions:
    <ol>
        <li>They all use cfscript</li>
        <li>You have session enabled</li>
    </ol>
    The second is an issue. You have to have sessions. The first, well you can wrap any of the commands in &lt;cfset <strong>command here</strong> /&gt; and it will work just as well.

	<li><a href="other.cfm">Non-self Posting example</a></li>
    <li><a href="ajax.cfm">AJAX Example</a> you will also need to look at <a href="setHeader.cfm">the processing page</a> to get the javascript implementation</li>
